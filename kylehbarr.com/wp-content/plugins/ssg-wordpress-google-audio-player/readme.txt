Simple. Tiny. Google. MP3 Player. Enough said?

== Description ==

There are a lot of mp3-playing Wordpress plugins available out there. This one aims to keep things simple and classy by employing the Google Audio Player service and an MP3-finding Auto-Embed script.

Features

* Uses Google’s Audio Player for MP3 content on your Wordpress website.
* Options page to configure player width, size, & background color
* Option to *Auto-Embed* the Google Audio Player, seamlessly replacing all Anchor tags (`<a ...>Text</a>`) with the Google Flash Player.
* Option to Auto-Start the player on page load.

== Installation ==

**Download & Install**

1. Download SSG Google Audio Player Wordpress Plugin
2. Unzip the downloaded archive
3. Upload whole ssg-google-audio-player folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
4. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress

**Usage**

1. Visit the **SSG Google Audio Player Settings Page** to configure your default player
2. If **Auto-Embed** is checked, the plugin will automatically replace all anchor tags (`<a ...>Text</a>`) linking to .mp3 files found in the body of your post.
3. If **Auto-Embed** is NOT checked, the plugin will look for the following shortcode and will replace it when found with the Google Audio Player.

shortcode:

`[gplayer href="MP3 FILE"]MP3 TITLE[/gplayer]`

4. Check the Default CSS box to enable to player style seen in the screenshots.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The player works fine in Opera, Firefox, Safari but chokes in IE8. What's the deal? =

The first two versions of this plugin did not pay nicely with IE8.  I believe thats all cleared up now.

= I'm having some trouble getting this plugin to work. Would you help me? =

Sure.  But you need to give me details. I need to know your system software (mac windows linux?) (version ?). I need to know the browser version you're using. I also need to know the version of Wordpress you are running, the theme, and any plugins that you are using.

Though its not necessary, a screenshot of the problem occurring would be great to send along to.  The more you give me the better your chances are that we get fix the issue.
